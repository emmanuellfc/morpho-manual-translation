# Installing _Morpho_

*Morpho* is hosted on a publicly available github repository
<https://github.com/Morpho-lang/morpho>. *Morpho* also requires two
subsidiary programs, a terminal app hosted in
<https://github.com/Morpho-lang/morpho-cli>, and a viewer application
<https://github.com/Morpho-lang/morpho-morphoview>. *Morpho* is
extendable, and packages providing additional functionality are hosted
in git repositories.

For this release, *morpho* can be installed on all supported platforms
using the homebrew package manager. Alternatively, the program can be
installed from source as described below. We are continuously working on
improving *morpho* installation, and hope to provide additional
mechanisms for installation in upcoming releases.
