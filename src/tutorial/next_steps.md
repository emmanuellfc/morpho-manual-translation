## Next steps

Having completed this tutorial, you may wish to explore the effect of
changing some of the parameters in the file. What happens if you change
`sigma` and W, the coefficients in front of the terms in the energy?
What happens if you take a different number of steps? Or change
properties of the Optimizers like `stepsize` and `steplimit`?

You should look at other example files provided in the `examples` folder
of the git repository. The remainder of the manual comprises chapters
exploring certain *morpho* concepts in more detail, followed by a
detailed reference manual for *morpho* functionality, and a complete
description of the scripting language.
