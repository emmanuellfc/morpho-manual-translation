## Uninstalling *morpho*

If you wish to uninstall morpho, you can do so simply from the terminal
application.

-   If you used homebrew to install morpho, simply type

        brew uninstall morpho

-   Alternatively, if you built *morpho* from source, you can remove
    everything with

        rm /usr/local/bin/morpho6
        rm /usr/local/bin/morphoview
        rm /usr/local/lib/libmorpho*
        rm -r /usr/local/share/morpho
        rm -r /usr/local/lib/morpho

    You may need to prefix these with `sudo`.
