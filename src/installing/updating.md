## Updating *morpho*

As new versions of *morpho* are released, you will likely want to
upgrade to the latest version. From the terminal:

-   If you used homebrew to install morpho, simply type,

        brew upgrade morpho

-   If you installed *morpho* manually, and still have the git
    repository folder on your computer, navigate to this with `cd` and
    type,

        git pull

    which downloads any updates. You can then follow the above
    instructions to recompile *morpho.* It's not necessary to reinstall
    dependencies, but note that some new releases of *morpho* may
    require additional dependencies.

-   If you no longer have the original *morpho* git repository folder
    from which you installed morpho, simply rerun the installation from
    scratch as above. You shouldn't need to reinstall dependencies.
