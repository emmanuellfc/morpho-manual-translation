## Install with homebrew

The simplest way to install *morpho* is through the [homebrew package
manager](https://brew.sh). To do so:

1.  If not already installed, install homebrew on your machine as
    described on the [homebrew website](https://brew.sh).

2.  Open a terminal and type:

        brew update
        brew tap morpho-lang/morpho
        brew install morpho

If you need to uninstall morpho, simply open a terminal and type
`brew uninstall morpho`. It's very important to uninstall the homebrew
morpho in this way *before* attempting to install from source as below.
